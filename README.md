Linked List with Stacks and Queues
Overview:
This repository contains a C++ implementation of a linked list where each node contains a stack, and each stack cell contains a queue. This structure allows for dynamic insertion, deletion, and manipulation of stacks and queues within a linked list framework.

Features
1. Insertion and Deletion:
2. Insert nodes at the front, back, or at a specified index.
3. Delete nodes from the front, back, or at a specified index.
   
Stack Operations:
1. Insertion of new stacks at specific nodes.
2. Deletion of stacks from specific nodes.
3. Sorting of all stacks.
   
Queue Operations:
1. Insertion of new queues at specific stacks and nodes.
2. Deletion of queues from specific stacks and nodes.
3. Sorting of all queues.
   
Sorting:
1. Sort individual queues within stacks.
2. Sort all stacks.
3. Sort nodes based on the front element of their respective stacks.
   
Display:
  Display the entire linked list structure with detailed visualization of stacks and queues.

To use this implementation:
git clone https://github.com/CapMushi/Linked-List-Stacks-Queues.git

Compile and run the main program (main.cpp).
g++ main.cpp -o main
./main

Follow the on-screen menu to interact with the linked list operations.

Menu Options
The program provides a menu-driven interface to perform various operations on the linked list:

Create new stacks and add them to the linked list.
Insert elements into specific stacks and queues.
Delete nodes, stacks, and queues.
Sort operations for queues, stacks, and nodes.
Display the current state of the linked list.
